# Project Status

- Header is now single-source via `assets/header.js` and injected into `#site-header` across all pages.
- Footer remains shared via `assets/footer.js`.
- Dropdowns are controlled by `assets/nav.js` only.

## Open items

- _None documented currently._ Review after any future header or navigation updates.
