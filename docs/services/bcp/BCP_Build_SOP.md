- Access to BCP_Lean_Template.md (structure).

---

## Steps

| Step | Task | Time (guide) |
|------|------|--------------|
| 1 | Open lean template; create new document (Word/Google Doc). | 5 min |
| 2 | Fill **Document Control** (title, version, owner, review dates). | 5 min |
| 3 | Fill **Purpose & Activation** (scope, L1/L2/L3 triggers from intake). | 10 min |
| 4 | Fill **Governance** table (roles from intake Q9–Q10). | 5 min |
| 5 | Fill **Critical Activities & Targets** from intake Q4–Q6 (Activity, Owner, MTD, RTO, resources, dependencies). | 15 min |
| 6 | Fill **Key Disruption Scenarios** from intake Q12 + 3–5 standard scenarios (Scenario, Impact, Immediate Action, Continuity Method). | 15 min |
| 7 | Leave **First 60-minute checklist** as-is (standard); add org-specific items if needed. | 5 min |
| 8 | Leave **Continuity Options** as tick list; add 1–2 org-specific if needed. | 2 min |
| 9 | Fill **Communications Plan** from intake Q11 (audience, owner, cadence, approval). | 8 min |
| 10 | **Return to Normal** and **Review & Testing** — keep standard bullets; set review date. | 5 min |
| 11 | Proofread; export PDF; send to client + offer one revision. | 5–10 min |

**Total:** ~60–90 min depending on complexity and number of activities/scenarios.

## Output

- One Word/PDF BCP (2–3 pages).
